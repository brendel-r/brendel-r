## About Me
Hi, I’m Rachel Hill, a designer and human systems enthusiast from a small farming town in northwest Kentucky. I graduated from the Turing School of Software and Design, where I learned the ins and outs of coding and app development. But honestly, my real passion is in exploring how people interact with technology and using that knowledge to design systems that are accessible, intuitive, and just plain fun to use.

I love combining design and psychology to create tools that make life easier for everyone. When I’m not working on a new project, you’ll probably find me hanging out with my husband and our quirky crew of animals, admiring beautiful landscapes, or diving into creative projects.

- 🎓 **Background:** I graduated from Turing School of Software and Design, where I learned how to code and make apps—but mostly how to survive on coffee and optimism. Now, I’m diving headfirst into my sophomore year at Arizona State University, where I’m leveling up my skills in design and psychology (and possibly seeing how much caffeine a human can consume in one semester)
- 🧠 **Focus:** Figuring out why people click that one button they weren’t supposed to and designing tools that make technology so simple even my goat Danny could use it (okay, maybe not, but I try).
- 🎯 **Goals:** Combine design, psychology, and human factors engineering to create solutions that make people say, *“Wow, that was easier than I expected!”*
- 💭 **Passions:** Human systems, user psychology, accessibility in design, and finding ways to make tech feel human (while avoiding unnecessary CAPTCHA tests).
- 💻 **Technical skills:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-hills-page/) or drop me an email at rhill57@asu.edu
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I live in a tiny farming town in western Kentucky with a parrot that talks all the time, a goat with too much personality, and a cow named Elle who’s *udderly* adorable...
